I'm proud to announce my completion of two semesters of [TechLauncher](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/), ANU's consultancy-like programme that matches bright and talented students with external clients to build innovative solutions to novel problems. Our team of five built a full-stack solution to address the lack of comprehensive, personalised online dog-training resources: a web application that guides the user in how to teach their dog correct behaviours and skills. The webapp has been deployed, and can be accessed here: [Pawfectly.co](https://pawfectly.co/). My personal role in this project was as the lead backend developer. We chose to use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), as it was simple to set  up and is appropriate for mobile solutions such as this one.
