# Overview

For my digital arts course, I was asked to make a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) social media advert for a supermarket item. After going through a few options in my head, I remembered this funny image about Oreos, which you can see on the right.

The resulting advert allows the user to make any permutation of cookies and cream, and dunk all of it into a glass of milk. You can play with it [here](https://Lax125.github.io/Moreo/).

Instead of using WEBGL, I emulated an isometric perspective for each disk using ellipses and rectangles. I used a simple state machine to decide what to draw each frame. For the smooth animations, I used frame counting to determine how far along each animation is.
